# Script

NATO forces have FOBs at Comms Alpha and Comms Bravo. NATO forces help the
local police with high-risk operations. A local Syndikat gang runs drugs and
other illegal contraband through the town of Tanouka. A local informant that
has contacted the `Captain` and claims to have found one of the gang's weapon
caches.

Two NATO fire teams (`Alpha 1-1` and `Alpha 2-1`) are dispatched from the FOB
at Comms Bravo to meet with the informant at the sugar factory west of town.
The informant will then lead the teams to where the weapon cache is hidden at
the factory.

As the teams pass through Tanouka they are lured into an ambush using a staged
car accident and a car bomb. The lead car with `Alpha 1-1` is destroyed. About
a dozen Syndikat bandits attack the remaining fire team but are killed or
driven off. The fire team decides to proceed to the factory on foot in order
to locate the informant in case his cover was blown. They search the factory
while repelling further attacks from Syndikat bandits until they find the
informant hiding out of fear. They escort the informant to the front of the
factory where a NATO helicopter lands to exfiltrate everyone.

## 01 - Intro

The two fire teams are in vehicles about half-way between Comms Bravo and
Tanouka. Fire team `Alpha 1-1` is in the lead car and `Alpha 1-2` is in the
chase car. The `Major` is driving the chase car and the `Captain` is in the
passenger seat.

1. `Major`: Where are we meeting your guy Captain?
2. `Captain`: He'll meet us behind the factory Office. He should already be
    there waiting for us now.
3. `Major`: What's this guy's story anyways? Are we paying him for this
    information? I know how much the locals like to search for non-existent
    contraband at our expense.
4. `Captain`: Not this guy. His wife and son were killed in that school
    bombing last year. His wife was a teacher and his son was in class when
    it happened.
5. `Major`: Oh man, so it's personal.
6. `Captain`: I'd say so, sir.

The vehicles come up to the scene of a car accident in the middle of Tanouka.

7. `Soldier`: Sir, there's an accident up ahead. I think we'll have to circle
    around.

## 02 - Ambush

A truck parked nearby explodes causing the lead vehicle to explode as well.
The chase vehicle is severely damaged and no longer drivable. No one in the
lead vehicle is injured though.

8. `Captain`: My god!
9. `Major`: Everyone out of the car and find some cover!

Everyone gets out of the second car.

10. `Major` to `Control`: Control, we just hit an IED, multiple KIA.
11. `Control`: Acknowledged. Secure the area and wait for backup.
12. `Captain`: Major, I've got a bad feeling about this.

About a dozen Syndikat bandits who were hiding in and around the nearby
buildings start attacking the fire team. The fire team kill or repel the
attack and at least the `Major` and `Captain` survive.

## 03 - Pivot

13. `Major`: Captain, do you think your informant sold us out?
14. `Captain`: No way Major, not on purpose. He probably needs our help.
15. `Major`: How far are we from the factory?
16. `Captain`: Probably less than a click west of here.
17. `Major`: Alright then, let's go get him.
18. `Major` to `Control`: Control, be advised, we're moving one click west to
    the sugar factory to search for our informant. We think he's in danger.
19. `Control`: Acknowledged, we'll keep an eye on you from above.

The fire team run to the factory.

## 04 - Search

The fire team enter the factory.

20. `Control`: Be advised, ISR reports a half dozen individuals in the area,
    likely Syndikat.
21. `Major` to `Control`: Acknowledged.
22. `Major`: Just great. Stay alert. Watch rooftops and corners.

The fire team find the informant within a few minutes while handling any
Syndikat bandits they find along the way. The informant was hiding somewhere
in the factory.

## 05 - Rescue

23. `Informant`: Thank god! I thought I was dead.
24. `Major` to `Control`: Control, we've found our man.
25. `Control`: Acknowledged. Be advised, your ride out is due to touch town
    outside the factory entrance momentarily.
26. `Captain` to `Informant`: What happened?
27. `Informant`: I heard the explosion and then shooting. I was about to leave
    when I saw a few of those bandits running towards the factory. So I hid.
28. `Captain`: Well it's over now. Let's get out of here.

A rescue helicopter dispatched from Comms Bravo lands outside the factory.
Everyone gets inside and the mission ends.

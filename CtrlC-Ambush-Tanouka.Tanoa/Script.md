# Script

NATO forces have FOBs at Comms Alpha and Comms Bravo. The soldiers help the
local police with high-risk operations. A local Syndikat gang runs drugs and
other illegal contraband through the nearby town of Tanouka. The gang members
use fear and intimidation to keep the local civilians in line and quiet. One
of the workers at a nearby factory, who's family was killed by gang members,
has decided to become an informant. He claims to have found one of the gang's
weapon caches hidden at the factory.

* `Control`: NATO dispatch.
* `Alpha 1`: NATO fire team in chase car.
  * `Lt. James Wright`: Lieutenant, Team Leader.
  * `Sgt. Dixon Watson`: Sergeant, Autorifleman.
  * `Cpl. Frost Clark`: Corporal, Combat Life Saver.
  * `Pvt. Jackson Hill`: Private, Grenadier.
* `Alpha 2`: NATO fire team in lead car.
* `Alpha 3`: NATO driver in chase car.
* `Takis Christou`: Civilian, Confidential Informant.

NATO fire teams are dispatched from the FOB at Comms Bravo to meet with the
informant at the sugar factory west of Tanouka. The informant will then lead
the teams to the weapon cache hidden at the factory. The mission starts as
the fire teams pull back on to the road towards Tanouka after taking a pit
stop.

As the teams pass through Tanouka they are lured into an ambush using a staged
car accident and a car bomb. The lead car is destroyed and it's occupants
killed. The driver of the chase car is also critically injured. About a dozen
Syndikat gang members attack the remaining fire team but are killed or driven
off. The remaining fire team decides to proceed to the factory on foot in order
to locate the informant in case his cover was blown. They search the factory
while repelling further attacks from Syndikat gang members until they find the
informant hiding out of fear. They escort the informant to the front of the
factory where a NATO helicopter lands to exfiltrate everyone. The mission
ends as the helicopter takes off and flies away from the factory.

## 01 - Intro

The cars slowly pull back on to the main road leading to Tanouka.

1. `Lt. Wright`: Let's hit it.
2. `Lt. Wright`: Sargeant Watson, where are we meeting your CI?
3. `Sgt. Watson`: Behind the front office, he should already be there now.
4. `Lt. Wright`: What's this guy's story anyways? I thought the locals were
  deathly afraid of the Syndikat. Why's he so willing to help?
5. `Sgt. Watson`: His wife and son were killed in that school bombing last
  year. His wife was a teacher and his son was in class when it happened.
6. `Lt. Wright`: Oh man, so this is personal.
7. `Sgt. Watson`: I'd say so, sir.

The vehicles enter Tanouka and approach the scene of a car accident. It
appears a truck took a turn too quickly and rolled over on it's side.

## 02 - Ambush

The overturned truck explodes causing the lead car to also explode, critically
injuring the driver of the chase car, and causing significant damage to the
chase car rendering it undrivable.

8. `Lt. Wright`: Everyone out!

Everyone gets out of the chase car.

9. `Lt. Wright` to `Control`: Control, we just hit an IED, multiple KIA.
10. `Control`: Acknowledged. Secure the area and wait for backup.
11. `Sgt. Watson`: Guys, I've got a bad feeling about this.

About a dozen Syndikat gang members who were hiding in and around the nearby
buildings start attacking the fire team. The fire team kill or repel the
attack and at least `Lt. Wright` and `Sgt. Watson` survive.

## 03 - Pivot

12. `Lt. Wright`: Sargeant Watson, do you think your CI sold us out?
13. `Sgt. Watson`: No way, not on purpose. He probably needs our help.
14. `Lt. Wright`: How far are we from the factory?
15. `Sgt. Watson`: Probably less than a click west of here.
16. `Lt. Wright`: Alright then, let's go get him.
17. `Lt. Wright` to `Control`: Control, be advised, we're moving one click west
  to the sugar factory to search for our CI. We think he's in danger.
18. `Control`: Acknowledged, we'll keep an eye on you from above.

The fire team run to the factory.

## 04 - Search

The fire team enter the factory.

19. `Control`: Be advised, ISR reports a half dozen individuals in the area,
    likely Syndikat gang members.
20. `Lt. Wright` to `Control`: Acknowledged.
21. `Lt. Wright`: Just great. Stay alert. Watch rooftops and corners.

The fire team search the factory and engage the gang members who are also
searching the factory for the CI. They eventually find the CI hiding
somewhere in the factory.

## 05 - Rescue

22. `Takis`: Thank god! I thought I was dead.
23. `Sgt. Watson`: Good thing we found you.
24. `Lt. Wright` to `Control`: Control, be advised, we've found our CI.
25. `Control`: Acknowledged. Be advised, `Viper 1` and `Viper 2` are inbound
  in a UH-80 to pick you up. ETA 2 minutes.
26. `Sgt. Watson` to `Takis`: What happened?
27. `Takis`: I heard the explosion in town and then shooting. I was about to
  leave when I saw gang members running towards the factory. So I hid.
28. `Sgt. Watson`: You did the right thing. We'll get you out of here.
29. `Lt. Wright`: Let's get out of here.

A rescue helicopter dispatched from Comms Bravo lands outside the factory.
Everyone gets inside the helicopter.

## 06 - Exfil

The helicopter takes off and starts flying back to Comms Bravo. The mission
ends successfully after it leaves the vicinity of the factory.
